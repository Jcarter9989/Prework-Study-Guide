## Description

- What motivates me is to learn a new language and get better at programming.
- The reason I built this project to see if I could follow directions and solve difficult problems.
- What I learned in this project was the difference between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. How each one of them work individually and how important each one is when programming a website. The different elements also how they are used to divide content on page and ways to show it browsers.

This Prework Study Guide can be used to help you with different topics in a webpage. These topic are HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. HTML gives the content structure. It is made up of elements which work together and the basic framework for all pages on the web. CSS gives the webpage style. Also CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout and organization. Git is used to make changes to files and makes collaboration easier and allow others to make changes before merging projects. JavaScript handles logic and allows users to interact with website.
